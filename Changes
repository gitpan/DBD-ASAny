Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.12	11th May 2001
  Fixed a problem with inout parameters where binding other parameters can
    cause us to find the incorrect location of the output parameter in the
    output SQLDA.
  Correctly handle NULL output parameters from procedures.
  Removed some debug printfs that snuck into v1.10.
  Corrected README to show that bind_param_inout is a supported function.
  Do not treat warnings as errors (err/errstr are still set but the calls
    to execute/fetch will not report a failure).

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.11	27th March 2001
  Calling a procedure or batch that returned a result set for which
    the engine could not infer the data types, errors were reported. Fixed
    by describing the cursor after it was opened.

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.10	13th November 2000
  Added support for AutoCommit.

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.09	21st September 2000
  Added support for type_info_all and (indirectly) quote()
  Added support for the following statement attributes:
    TYPE, ASATYPE, SCALE, PRECISION, NULLABLE, CursorName,
    Statement, and RowsInCache. 
  	RowsInCache always returns undef.
	ASATYPE returns an array of native ASA type codes which
	  is more detailed than the ODBC-types returned
	  by the TYPE attribute. ASA type codes correspond to
	  integer values defined in sqldef.h or you can use
	  ASA type codes directly by doing 'use DBD::ASAny qw(:asa_types);'
  Changed handling of parameters to the connect() method to be more
    consistent with other drivers.
  Fixed a memory leak: space allocated for non-string, non-binary fields
    of an output SQLDA were not freed.

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.08	15th August 2000
  When executing a statement that affected zero rows, an error was
    reported rather than success.
  Fixed driver to build with ActivePerl build 616 and DBI 1.14.
  Makefile now searches for SQLAnywhere in /opt/SYBSsa[6-9] as well as
    /opt/SYBSasa[6-9].

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.07	17th May 2000
  Fixed bug introduced in 1.06 - a statement that is prepared
    then dropped before being used could cause a GPF.
  Minor revision to license text.

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.06	10th March 2000
  Added support for blobs and long strings. Values transferred to
    or from the engine can be up to 2GB in size. Default LongReadLen
    value for DBD::ASAny is 1MB. There is no default limit to
    the length of string that can be written (there appears to be
    no 'LongWriteLen' attribute in DBI).
  Added support for treating strings as binary data. When sending
    data to the engine (for an insert or update), the user must
    provide the DBI::SQL_BINARY or similar type attribute in
    a bind_param call. For fetching data, DBD::ASAny automatically
    detects that a column is binary. If binary data is treated as
    text it may be subjected to character set translation.
  Removed reference to GNU public license/Artistic license.

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.05	25th January 2000

  Added Sybase license agreement
  Adding a call to db_fini when a connection attempt failed. Not calling
    db_fini in this situation caused a memory leak.
  Added better handling for detecting new ASA versions -- should handle
   up to version 9 now (which doesn't exist yet...)

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.04	19th November 1999

  Fixed inout parameter support.
  Moved changes info from Makefile.PL to this file.

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.03	9th November 1999

  Driver now builds on HPUX, AIX, Linux with native and GNU compilers.
  Dynamically resize SQLDA for bind variables or output values if the
    default size is not large enough.
  Avoid "memory leak" caused by dblib holding onto cursor information
    so that the cursor can be reopend without being redeclared.

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.02	21st October 1999

  Driver should now be thread safe & it builds with the
    threaded version of perl; however, perl threads and/or DBI
    in a threaded environment is very unstable. Simple multithreaded
    tests easily crash perl.

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.01	5th August 1999

  Initial Win32 support by Matthew C. Keranen (mck@iag.net).
  Win32 version requires ActivePerl (www.activestate.com).

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.00	8th December 1998

  Changed SQL Anywhere driver (DBD::SQLAny) into Adaptive Server Anywhere
    driver(DBD::ASAny)
