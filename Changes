Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.03	9th November 1999

  Driver now builds on HPUX, AIX, Linux with native and GNU compilers.
  Dynamically resize SQLDA for bind variables or output values if the
    default size is not large enough.
  Avoid "memory leak" caused by dblib holding onto cursor information
    so that the cursor can be reopend without being redeclared.

Changes in DBD::ASAny 1.02	21st October 1999

  Driver should now be thread safe & it builds with the
    threaded version of perl; however, perl threads and/or DBI
    in a threaded environment is very unstable. Simple multithreaded
    tests easily crash perl.
